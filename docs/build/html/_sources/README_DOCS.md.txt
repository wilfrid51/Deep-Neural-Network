### |:interrobang:| Why?

Although Deep Learning has undergone spectacular growth in the recent decade,
a large portion of experimental evidence is not supported by statistical hypothesis tests. Instead, 
conclusions are often drawn based on single performance scores. 

This is problematic: Neural network display highly non-convex
loss surfaces (Li et al., 2018) and their performance depends on the specific hyperparameters that were found, or stochastic factors 
like Dropout masks, making comparisons between architectures more difficult. Based on comparing only (the mean of) a 
few scores, **we often cannot 
conclude that one model type or algorithm is better than another**.
This endangers the progress in the field, as seeming success due to random chance might practitioners astray. 

For instance,
a recent study in Natural Language Processing by Narang et al. (2021) has found that many modifications proposed to 
transformers do not actually improve performance. Similar issues are known to plague other fields like e.g. 
Reinforcement Learning (Henderson et al., 2018) and Computer Vision (Borji, 2017) as well. 

To help mitigate this problem, this package supplies fully-tested re-implementations of useful functions for significance
testing:
* Non-parametric tests such as Almost Stochastic Order (Dror et al., 2019), bootstrap (Efron & Tibshirani, 1994) and 
  permutation-randomization.
* p-value corrections methods such as Bonferroni (Bonferroni, 1936) and Fisher (Fisher, 1992). 

All functions are fully tested and also compatible with common deep learning data structures, such as PyTorch / 
Tensorflow tensors as well as NumPy and Jax arrays.  For examples about the usage, consult the documentation 
[here](deep-significance.rtfd.io/en/latest/) or the scenarios in the section [Examples](#examples).

## |:inbox_tray:| Installation

(**The package has not been released on PyPI yet**)

The package can simply be installed using `pip` by running

    pip3 install deepsig

Another option is to clone the repository and install the package locally:

    git clone https://github.com/Kaleidophon/deep-significance.git
    cd deep-significance
    pip3 install -e .

**Warning**: Installed like this, imports will fail when the clones repository is moved.

## |:bookmark:| Examples

In the following, I will lay out three scenarios that describe common use cases for ML practitioners and how to apply 
the methods implemented in this package accordingly. For an introduction into statistical hypothesis testing, please
refer to resources such as [this blog post](https://machinelearningmastery.com/statistical-hypothesis-tests/) for a general
overview or [Dror et al. (2018)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1128.pdf) for a NLP-specific point of view. 


### Scenario 1 - Comparing multiple runs of two models 

In the simplest scenario, we have retrieved a set of scores from a model A and a baseline B on a dataset, stemming from 
various model runs with different seeds. We can now simply apply the ASO test:

```python
from deepsig import aso

scores_a = ...  # TODO
scores_b = ...  # TODO

min_eps = aso(scores_a, scores_b)  # min_eps = ..., so A is better
```

Because ASO is a non-parametric test, **it does not make any assumptions about the distributions of the scores**. 
This means that we can apply it to any kind of test metric. The scores of model runs are supplied, the more reliable 
the test becomes.

### Scenario 2 - Comparing multiple runs across datasets

@TODO: Comparison between two models, multiple datasets

### Scenario 3 - Comparing sample-level scores

@TODO: Comparison between two models, multiple seeds, sample-level
